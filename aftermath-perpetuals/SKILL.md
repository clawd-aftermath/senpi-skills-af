# Aftermath Perpetuals Skill

Verified against OpenAPI: `https://aftermath.finance/api/openapi/spec.json`
Canonical docs UI: `https://aftermath.finance/docs`

## Fast Routing

Choose one file first; do not load everything by default.

Default preference: start with native perpetuals endpoints (`/api/perpetuals/*`) because they expose the full Aftermath feature set. Use CCXT endpoints when you specifically need exchange-style compatibility.

1. CCXT endpoint work -> `ccxt.md`
2. Native perpetuals endpoint work -> `native.md`
3. SDK method usage -> `sdk-reference.md`
4. API failures/retries -> `error-handling.md`
5. Trading safeguards -> `safety-and-risk.md`
6. Builder codes/gas pool/referrals/rewards/coins utility routes -> `auxiliary-endpoints.md`
7. Edge-case pitfalls -> `gotchas.md`
8. Market making optimization, gas efficiency, cancel-and-place -> `market-making.md`

## Integration Modes

Preferred by default: Native perpetuals (`/api/perpetuals/*`) for complete API coverage.

| Mode | Best for | Primary file |
|---|---|---|
| CCXT compatibility (`/api/ccxt/*`) | Exchange-style payloads and build-sign-submit bots | `ccxt.md` |
| Native perpetuals (`/api/perpetuals/*`) | Full account/vault previews + tx builders | `native.md` |
| TypeScript SDK (`@aftermath-finance/sdk`) | Typed app integrations | `sdk-reference.md` |

## High-Risk Guardrails

- Sign `signingDigest`, not `transactionBytes`.
- Keep ID types strict: CCXT write `accountId` (object ID) vs native `accountId` (numeric).
- Treat preview responses as success/error unions.
- Re-sync snapshots after stream reconnect before applying deltas.
- Serialize coin/gas-object-sensitive operations to avoid version conflicts.

## Recent API Updates

- Native account/vault routes include `place-scale-order`, `cancel-and-place-orders`, and account `share` transaction support.
- Account history now includes both `orders` (order history) and detailed `trades` / CSV export routes.
- Margin history requests use `timeframe` (`1D | 1W | 1M | ALL`) with `accountId`.
- Stop-order data requests support optional `marketIds` filtering.
- Vault owner flows include locked-liquidity withdraw routes and a preview route for pausing force-withdraw processing.
- CCXT submit supports one-or-more `signatures` when sender and gas owner differ.
- Rewards endpoints include signed points lookups, and auxiliary docs now cover the gas pool service.
- **Gas Pool sponsorship**: Pre-fund a gas pool, deposit SUI or USDC (auto-swaps), grant agent wallets, trade with `sponsor` field.
- **USDC as gas**: Deposit USDC into GasPool — auto-swaps to SUI via Aftermath router. Agent wallets never need SUI.

## Progressive Disclosure

| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| `ccxt.md` | You need `/api/ccxt/*` endpoints or stream setup |
| `native.md` | You need `/api/perpetuals/*` account/market/vault APIs |
| `auxiliary-endpoints.md` | You need builder-codes, gas pool, referrals, rewards, coins, utility txs |
| `sdk-reference.md` | You are coding with SDK classes and methods |
| `error-handling.md` | You are implementing retry, backoff, and failure parsing |
| `safety-and-risk.md` | You are shipping a bot or live strategy safeguards |
| `gotchas.md` | You need a pre-launch pitfalls checklist |
| `market-making.md` | You are building an MM bot or optimizing gas for quoting |

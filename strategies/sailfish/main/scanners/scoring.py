"""SAILFISH — pure relative-strength thesis math (no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

A faithful Runtime 3.0 port of the v2 Sailfish producer's pure logic
(`relative_strength`, `rank_assets`, `leader_above_runner_up`) plus the inline
score builder from v2 `main()`. The math/indexing is reproduced VERBATIM so a
fidelity harness can diff this against the v2 producer on the same market
snapshot.

Sailfish ranks the whitelist (BTC/ETH/SOL/HYPE) by 4h relative strength each
tick and longs the leader iff (a) the leader's own RS >= minLeaderRsPct AND
(b) the leader beats the runner-up by >= leaderMarginPct (no whipsaw on tight
races). Single-position; the producer never closes — rotation is realized via
the DSL trail's natural exit + the next tick's re-evaluation.

`scan.py` does the MCP reads + state; this module stays pure and unit-testable
on plain close lists.

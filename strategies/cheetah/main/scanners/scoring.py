"""CHEETAH — pure thesis math (no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

A faithful Runtime 3.0 port of the v2 Cheetah producer's confluence scorer
(`score_confluence`) + `get_leverage_for_score` (SKILL.md v7.2.0). The math is
reproduced VERBATIM so a fidelity harness can diff this against the v2 producer on
the same market snapshot. Behaviour-preserving quirks from v2 are kept and flagged
`# v2-quirk`; fix them only as a separate, labelled change AFTER the port is validated.

Universe scanner: `score_confluence` scores ONE normalized market dict; the caller
(scan.py) iterates the top-100 SM leaderboard, picks the single strongest candidate,
and resolves the leverage tier. Unit-testable on plain dicts."""

    `get_rank_climb(history, token, dex)` inside this function; scan.py now resolves it
    from ctx.state and hands it in, keeping this module pure / clock-free). The

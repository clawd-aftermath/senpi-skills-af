"""WHALEHUNTER — pure cohort-divergence math (no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

A faithful Runtime 3.0 port of the v2 WhaleHunter v2.0 cohort engine
(whalehunter-producer.py). Given trader-state dicts already fetched by scan.py,
this bucketing/scoring is reproduced VERBATIM so a fidelity harness can diff it
against the v2 producer on the same snapshot. Shared verbatim by both sleeves;
the sleeve's direction is passed in (LONG for the long wallet, SHORT for the short).

The thesis: segment Hyperliquid traders into a SMART cohort (high lifetime realized
PnL) and a CROWD cohort, aggregate each cohort's NET positioning per coin, and fire
when the smart cohort is net-directional past a threshold AND adding to it daily,
with the crowd ideally on the other side. Position WITH the smart money, not the crowd."""

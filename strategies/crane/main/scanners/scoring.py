"""CRANE — Managed Pairs / Stat-Arb engine (pure: no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

Market-neutral. For a correlated pair (A, B) it tracks the log price spread
ln(A/B), z-scores it over a rolling window, and trades the SPREAD: when the pair
dislocates it shorts the rich leg / longs the cheap leg (equal notional), and it
manages the two legs as ONE position — they open together and MUST close together
on reversion, on a blowout stop, or the instant one leg goes missing.

That last rule is the safety core: a pair with only one leg left is a naked
directional bet. `decide_pair_action` returns CLOSE_NAKED whenever exactly one leg
is held, so the manager can flatten the survivor immediately.

⚠️ BLOCKED ON A RUNTIME CAPABILITY — see crane/DESIGN.md. The Runtime 3.0 scan
contract emits OPEN-only signals (no close/reduce intent) and blocks close
mutations, and CLOSE_POSITION has no scanner-signal path. So CLOSE_BOTH /
CLOSE_NAKED cannot currently be executed — which is exactly why crane ships as a
tested engine + design, NOT a deployable package. This module is complete and
unit-tested so it is ready to wire the moment coordinated multi-leg close exists.

"""ANT — Funding Harvester engine (pure: no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

The best Senpi-achievable version of a cash-and-carry funding trade. Senpi is
perps-only (no spot execution on HyperEVM), so ant cannot place the long-spot hedge
that makes true cash-and-carry delta-neutral. Instead it harvests funding the one
way the runtime allows — by SHORTING perps that pay positive funding (longs pay
shorts) — and it manages the resulting DIRECTIONAL price risk with an exhaustion
gate + a tight DSL stop.

⚠️ This is a DIRECTIONAL funding carry, NOT delta-neutral. You collect the funding
but you are short the perp; if the name squeezes up, the loss can dwarf the carry.
That risk is the price of the missing spot leg — see ant/NOTES.md.

The edge that makes it more than a naive funding short: ant only shorts a
high-funding name when the long crowd looks EXHAUSTED (overbought / rolling over /
not making fresh highs), never a name that is still ripping. High funding on a
still-accelerating name is a steamroller; ant skips it.

Pure halves:
  1. INDICATORS — trend_structure / calc_rsi / price_momentum (ported from bison).
  2. FUNDING + EXHAUSTION — funding_signal, exhaustion_score, and build_signal
     (short-only, funding gate ∧ persistence ∧ not-still-ripping).

FUNDING SOURCE: the funding fields (annualized_pct, funding_direction,
persistence_hours, trend) come straight from `market_get_funding_history` — the
call + parse are ported from pangolin (a live strategy), so ant uses the tool's
NATIVE annualized % and its LONG/SHORT collecting-side flag rather than recomputing
an APR from a raw rate (avoids the hourly-vs-8h ambiguity entirely). OI shape from
asset_context is still best-effort tolerant.

"""BOBCAT — pure thesis math (no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

A faithful Runtime 3.0 port of the v2 Bobcat producer's `trend_structure` +
`build_thesis` scoring (SKILL.md v1.0.0 / bobcat-producer.py v1.0.1). The
math/indexing is reproduced VERBATIM so a fidelity harness can diff this against
the v2 producer on the same market snapshot. Behaviour-preserving quirks from v2
are kept and flagged `# v2-quirk`.

Multi-asset (12-name big-tech whitelist), single-pass, unit-testable on plain
candle lists. Smart-money lean (`sm`) is fetched by the caller (scan.py) and
passed in, so this module stays pure.

Bobcat is a GATED scorer (unlike Bison, where signals are score contributors):
  - 4h trend must be non-neutral (else None),
  - Smart-Money direction must be LONG/SHORT AND equal the 4h-derived direction,
  - SM tilt must be >= smTiltMinPct.
If any gate fails, build_thesis returns None. The minScore floor is applied by
the CALLER (scan.py), exactly as v2 main() did.

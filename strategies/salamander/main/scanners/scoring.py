"""SALAMANDER — pure thesis math (no I/O, no MCP, no clock).

A faithful Runtime 3.0 port of the v2 Salamander producer's `trend_4h` +
`detect_pullback` + `build_thesis` 5-component pullback scoring (SKILL.md v1.0.0 /
salamander-producer.py v1.0.1). The math/indexing is reproduced VERBATIM so a
fidelity harness can diff this against the v2 producer on the same market
snapshot. Behaviour-preserving quirks from v2 are kept and flagged `# v2-quirk`;
fix them only as a separate, labelled change AFTER the port is validated.

Multi-asset, single-pass, unit-testable on plain candle lists. `sm` (smart-money
lean) is fetched by the caller and passed in, so this module stays pure.

THESIS (v2 verbatim): buy the dip in an uptrend / short the rally in a downtrend.
LONG when the 4h trend is BULLISH AND the latest 1h close has pulled back 3-7%
from the recent (prior 24h) high AND smart-money is net LONG at >= smTiltMinPct
(default 55%); SHORT when the 4h trend is BEARISH AND the latest 1h close has
rallied 3-7% from the recent (prior 24h) low AND SM is net SHORT at >= 55%. The
4h-trend-non-neutral gate, the pullback band, and the SM-direction agreement are
ALL HARD GATES (return None if any fails). The midpoint (4-6%) and strong-SM
(>=70%) bonuses are score contributors only. Max score ~9; minScore (default 5)
is applied by the CALLER.

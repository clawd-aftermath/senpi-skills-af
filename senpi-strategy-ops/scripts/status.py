"""What strategies am I running? — the single source of truth, with runtime health.

  python3 status.py            # every open strategy, grouped by package
  python3 status.py <id>       # only the <id> package
  python3 status.py --json

Reads live truth (MCP strategy_list ∪ openclaw runtime list) — NOT the ephemeral deploy state. For each
OPEN strategy it classifies the runtime:
  healthy/degraded/unhealthy — ACTIVE strategy + live runtime, upgraded from process-level "running" to
                               the runtime's OWN verdict via `openclaw senpi status -r <id>` (+ position
                               count). `--fast` skips this per-runtime call and just reports `running`.
  runtime-stopped  — ACTIVE strategy + runtime exists but not running
  no-runtime       — autonomous PACKAGE strategy (skillName, no trader) with NO runtime → funded but not
                     running (likely an interrupted deploy); the only no-runtime case that's an anomaly
  runtime-unknown  — openclaw is not on THIS host, so the runtime registry isn't visible from here;
                     NOT a diagnosis (run status.py on the runtime host for the real verdict)
  copy             — copy-trading strategy (follows a traderAddress) — run by Senpi's copy engine, no runtime
  manual           — manual / app-managed strategy — you manage it in the app, no runtime
and separately flags orphan runtimes (a runtime with no open strategy). A strategy off the runtime is NOT
broken — it's just not autonomous; status.py says how it's managed. `healthy` ≠ a confirmed scanner tick —
use `deploy.py verify <id>` for that.

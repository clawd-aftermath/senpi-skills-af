"""Close a strategy PACKAGE — stop the runtime(s), TRIGGER strategy_close, return immediately.

  python3 close.py <id> [--instance <name>] [--dry-run] [--json]
  python3 close.py --all                       # close EVERY open strategy + delete their runtimes

Does NOT wait for the on-chain flatten — it hands off to the agent to poll. Per strategy (discovered
from strategy_list by attribution skillName == manifest id; sid + wallet read from the strategy record,
not the runtime, so orphans close too):
  1. STOP    — openclaw senpi runtime delete (if a runtime is live), confirm gone.
  2. TRIGGER — submit MCP strategy_close(<strategyId>) — flattens ALL positions + closes the strategy
               (returns funds). Submit only; no poll.
  → reports `closing`. strategy_close is async, so POLL by re-running `close.py <id>`: it's idempotent
    (runtime already gone → skip; status already closing/closed → skip re-submit) and reports `closed`
    once the strategy leaves the active set.

--instance scopes which instance(s) to close; --dry-run prints the plan with no side effects.

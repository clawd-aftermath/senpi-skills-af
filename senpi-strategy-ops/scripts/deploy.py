"""Deploy a strategy PACKAGE in three short, resumable steps (so no single call blocks past the
tool/session timeout). The SCRIPT does the work deterministically — the agent just runs the steps
in order and re-runs a step until it reports done.

  python3 deploy.py create  <id> --budget <usd> [--max-wait S] [--dry-run] [--json]
  python3 deploy.py runtime  <id> [--decision-model M] [--dry-run] [--json]
  python3 deploy.py verify   <id> [--max-wait S] [--json]
  python3 deploy.py status   <id> [--json]

Step 1 `create`  — creating wallets & funding them: per instance strategy_create_custom_strategy (records
                   strategyId IMMEDIATELY), then poll strategy_list until ACTIVE, BOUNDED by --max-wait.
                   Not all ACTIVE yet → exits `creating`; re-run `create` to RESUME (never re-creates).
                   Refuses if it finds skillName==<id> strategies not in the state file (close first).
Step 2 `runtime` — setting up the autonomous trading strategy: render each runtime.yaml with its wallet →
                   openclaw senpi runtime create. Fast, self-healing. AFTER THIS, DEPLOY IS DONE — the
                   strategy trades autonomously (scans on its own interval). Do NOT wait for the first tick.
`verify`         — OPTIONAL, only if asked "is it scanning yet?": one non-blocking check that a scan fired.

State lives in <pkg>/.deploy-state.json: per instance {strategyId, wallet, status}. Every sub-action
is persisted, so a kill mid-step just means re-run that step. The package is fetched from the remote
on first use if it isn't on disk.

      ticked     — runCount>0 / heartbeat (lastAliveAt) / runtime-reported healthy — actually scanning

    `ticked`/`scheduled`/`supervised` all count as LIVE. Two enrichment sources, keyed by the stable
    scanner name (== the runtime's `scannerId`):
      • `senpi state`  — the rich per-scanner row (runCount, lastAliveAt, lastError, enabled, health).
        Best when available, but `getSystemState` THROWS for minutes after a fresh start, so `state`
        is often None here (see `_cli.runtime_state`).
      • `senpi status` — the runtime's own per-scanner health verdict. Lighter, and it keeps
        answering while `state` is still throwing — so it's the fallback that keeps a live-but-not-
        -yet-introspectable scanner from being branded dead.

    IMPORTANT — external scanners: runCount/lastRun stay 0/null until the runtime hears the first
    POST, and a healthy scanner that finds no setup still ticks (barren heartbeat). So absence of
    runs is NEVER breakage on its own; `health`/`lastAliveAt` and the `status` verdict carry the
